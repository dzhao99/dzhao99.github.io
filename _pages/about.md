I am a first-year Ph.D student advised by Prof. [Renjie Zhao](https://renjiezhao.github.io) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu)(JHU), majoring in Computer Science. I am broadly interested in wireless networking, mobile computing and intelligent IOT systems.

Before joining JHU, I received a master's degree in Electrical and Computering Engineering at [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu)(UCLA), supervised by Prof. [Danijela Cabric](https://cores.ee.ucla.edu/people/danijela-cabric/). I earned my bachelor's degree in Electronics Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn)(ZJU).
